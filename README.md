# LambdaExpressionBasics

Lambda expressions are added in Java 8. 

Lambda expression provide functional programming. 

Some Points which explain why we need function programming:
1) Usage of functions as input to and output from other functions.
2) Usage of map, filter, and reduce type functions instead of looping
3) Concurrency, which is easier to do with functional programming because the compiler is taking care of most of the operations.
